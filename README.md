Once there was a student who attended CSSI.
In the first week she learned Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
She hates CSS.
But Javascript is ok.
Python is much better.

However, she would soon learn that things that seem hard at first get easier with more practice.

Everyday she kept learning and went back home to find out that it started to become second nature for her.
