Once there was a magical unicorn who attended the mystical yet mysterious CSSI.
In the first week she learned Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
She hates CSS.
But Javascript is ok.
Python is much better.

However, she would soon learn that things that seem hard at first get easier with more practice.

Every second the unicorn kept learning: it became third nature for her.
